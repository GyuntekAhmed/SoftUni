As a MOBA challenger player, Petar has the bad habit to trash his PC when he loses a game and rage quits. His gaming setup consists of a headset, mouse, keyboard, and display. You will receive Petar's lost games count. 
Every second lost game, Petar trashes his headset.
Every third lost game, Petar trashes his mouse.
When Petar trashes both his mouse and headset in the same lost game, he also trashes his keyboard.
