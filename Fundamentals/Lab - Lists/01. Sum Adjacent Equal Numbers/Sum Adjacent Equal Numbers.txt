Create a program to sum all of the adjacent equal numbers in a list of decimal numbers, starting from left to right.

•	After two numbers are summed, the result could be equal to some of its neighbors and should be summed as well (see the examples below)
•	Always sum the leftmost two equal neighbors (if several couples of equal neighbors are available)
