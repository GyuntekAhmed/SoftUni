Write a program that accumulates coins. Until the "Start" command is given, you will receive coins, and only the valid ones should be accumulated. Valid coins are:
•	0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2
If an invalid coin is inserted, print "Cannot accept {money}" and continue to the next line.
On the next lines, until the "End" command is given you will start receiving products, which a customer wants to buy. The vending machine has only:
•	"Nuts" with a price of 2.0
•	"Water" with a price of 0.7
•	"Crisps" with a price of 1.5
•	"Soda" with a price of 0.8
•	"Coke" with a price of 1.0
If the customer tries to purchase a not existing product print "Invalid product".
When a customer has enough money to buy the selected product, print "Purchased {product name}", otherwise print "Sorry, not enough money", and continue to the next line.
When the "End" command is given print the reminding balance, formatted to the second decimal point: "Change: {money left}".
