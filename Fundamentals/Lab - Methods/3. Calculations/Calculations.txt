Create a program that receives three lines of input:
•	On the first line, a string - "add", "multiply", "subtract", "divide"
•	On the second line, a number
•	On the third line, another number
You should create four methods (for each calculation) and invoke the corresponding method depending on the command. The method should also print the result (needs to be void).
