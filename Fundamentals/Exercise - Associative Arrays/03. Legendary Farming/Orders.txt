You’ve done all the work and the last thing left to accomplish is to own a legendary item.
However, it's a tedious process and it requires quite a bit of farming.
Anyway, you are not too pretentious - any legendary item will do. The possible items are:
•	Shadowmourne - requires 250 Shards;
•	Valanyr - requires 250 Fragments;
•	Dragonwrath - requires 250 Motes;
Shards, Fragments and Motes are the key materials and everything else is junk.
You will be given lines of input, in the format: "2 motes 3 ores 15 stones"
Keep track of the key materials - the first one that reaches the 250 marks, wins the race.
At that point, you have to print that the corresponding legendary item is obtained.
Then, print the remaining shards, fragments, motes, each on a new line.
Finally, print the collected junk items.
