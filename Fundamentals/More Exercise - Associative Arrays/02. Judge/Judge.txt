You know the judge system, right?! Your job is to create a program similar to the Judge system. 
You will receive several input lines in one of the following formats:
"{username} -> {contest} -> {points}"

The constestName and username are strings, the given points will be an integer number.
You need to keep track of every contest and individual statistics of every user.
You should check if such a contest already exists, and if not, add it, otherwise,
check if the current user Is participating in the contest, if he is participating take the higher score, otherwise, just add it. 
Also, you need to keep individual statistics for each user - the total points of all contests. 
You should end your program when you receive the command "no more time".
At that point, you should print each contest in order of input, 
for each contest print the participants ordered by points in descending order, then ordered by name in ascending order. 
After that, you should print individual statistics for every participant ordered by total points in descending order,
and then by alphabetical order.
