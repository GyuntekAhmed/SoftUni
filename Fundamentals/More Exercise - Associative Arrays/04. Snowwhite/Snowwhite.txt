Snow White loves her dwarfs, but there are so many and she doesn’t know how to order them.
Does she order them by name? Or by the color of their hat? Or by physics?
She can’t decide, so it's up to you to write a program that does it for her.
You will be receiving several input lines which contain data about dwarfs in the following format:
"{dwarfName} <:> {dwarfHatColor} <:> {dwarfPhysics}"

The dwarfName and the dwarfHatColor are strings. The dwarfPhysics is an integer.

You must store the dwarfs in your program. There are several rules though:
•	If 2 dwarfs have the same name but different colors, they should be considered different dwarfs, and you should store both of them.
•	If 2 dwarfs have the same name and the same color, store the one with the higher physics.

When you receive the command "Once upon a time", the input ends.
You must order the dwarfs by physics in descending order and then by the total count of dwarfs with the same hat color in descending order. 
Then you must print them all.
