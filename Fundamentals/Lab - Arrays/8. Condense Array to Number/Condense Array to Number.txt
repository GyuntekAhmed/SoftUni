Create a program to read an array of integers and condense them by summing all adjacent couples of elements until a single integer remains.
For example, let us say we have 3 elements - {2, 10, 3}.
We sum the first two and the second two elements and get {2 + 10, 10 + 3} = {12, 13}, then we sum all adjacent elements again.
This results in {12 + 13} = {25}.
