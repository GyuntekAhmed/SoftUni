Create a program that checks if a given password is valid.

The password validation rules are:

•	It should contain 6 – 10 characters (inclusive)
•	It should contain only letters and digits
•	It should contain at least 2 digits 


If it is not valid, for any unfulfilled rule print the corresponding message:
•	"Password must be between 6 and 10 characters"
•	"Password must consist only of letters and digits"
•	"Password must have at least 2 digits"
