On the first line, you will be given a username, your task is to try to log in the user. The user’s password is username reversed. On the next lines, you will receive passwords:
•	If the password is incorrect print "Incorrect password. Try again."
•	If the password is correct print: "User {username} logged in." and stop the program
Keep in mind, on the fourth attempt if the password is still not correct print: "User {username} blocked!"
Then the program stops.
